These colors are used to highlight different sections and functionalities, creating a dynamic and engaging user experience. Accent colors such as light grey and white are used for backgrounds and text to ensure readability and a clean look.

Typography: The app features modern, sans-serif fonts such as Helvetica Neue or Open Sans for clean and easy-to-read text. Heading fonts are bold and slightly larger, ensuring clear hierarchy and emphasis.
Pages and Functionality:
